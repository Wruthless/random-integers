# RNG In Java
Exploring some various RNG methods in Java.

### Craps.java
A simple simulation of a craps game using `SecureRandom` to generate the die throws.

### RandomIntegers.java
A simple `SecureRandom` test with some conditions.

### RollDie.java
An example application I did for a Java tutorial showing a naive approach to capturing data and displaying it. Can obviously be optimized using lambdas and/or arrays.
